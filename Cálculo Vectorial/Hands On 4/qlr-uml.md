## Theory

A quadratic regression is the process of finding the equation of the parabola that best fits a set of data. As a result, we get an equation of the form:

y=ax2+bx+c where aâ‰ 0.

The best way to find this equation manually is by using the least squares method. That is, we need to find the values of a,b,and c such that the squared vertical distance between each point (xi,yi) and the quadratic curve y=ax2+bx+c is minimal.
